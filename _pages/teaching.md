### Selected Student Feedback

*I really enjoyed Econ 202 with Chandler Lester. The lectures were interesting and I credit this class with giving me a greater interest in Economics. 
When difficult concepts arose, Chandler was able to describe the situation very clearly, and I enjoyed the real world examples that were often brought to class. 
I felt like I learned a lot, and I finished with the feeling of gaining a broad and firmer grasp on macroeconomic topics. 
I also thought that the tests were really fair, they were difficult, but the questions reflected what was discussed in lecture to a T. 
I personally really enjoyed the class, Chandler’s teaching style, and the content overall.* --EC 202 

*I really loved taking Econ 202 with Chandler, she was really helpful, always listened to the students and taught the material well. 
She was graceful in class when students talked over her but she also held her ground in a polite way that kept the attention on the class. 
I would 1000% take another class with her.* --EC 202 

*Was a great class especially considering that all the classes changed to online with almost no time to prepare. 
If I had any questions throughout the term I would email her and she was always quick to respond and help anyway she could. 
The organization of the content was well layed out and easy to follow. Was a fantastic teacher and will excel in any position. 
Thank you for a great term and best wishes in all your future endeavours.* --EC 313 (Spring 2020) 

*Very helpful, engaged, and understanding instructor.* --EC 313 (Spring 2020)

*Instructor did a great job at keeping class engaged. Very good at explaining how answers are obtained and encourages questions to be
asked if need be.* --EC 313 (Fall 2018)
